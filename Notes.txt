Refactored to some extent. 
I now bypass the fetch api call to get the small amount of json-data, and the dynamic typing is handled by a 'Typewriter'-class. 
I still need to significantly refactor to make the project managable.

As always I hit severe scope-roadblocks. 
Very uncertain about what object should be global, passed as function parameters, and when you can access a variable after an eventlistener i triggered.
